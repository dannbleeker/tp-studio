/**
 * Session 82 — Playwright test hook.
 *
 * The Playwright e2e suite runs against the production `vite preview`
 * build, so it can't `import` from `@/store` directly. Driving the UI
 * with `page.mouse.dblclick()` to seed entities turned out to be flaky
 * on the GitHub-Actions Ubuntu runner (the dblclick gesture races with
 * React Flow's mount, and exact `toHaveCount(N)` assertions fail
 * intermittently — see the e2e-debt entry under Session 81 in the
 * CHANGELOG).
 *
 * The fix is to expose a tiny deterministic seeding surface on `window`
 * — but only when the page explicitly opts in via `?test=1`. Regular
 * users never see it; Playwright opts in at `page.goto('/?test=1')`.
 *
 * The hook exposes the live `useDocumentStore` plus a small `seed()`
 * helper that captures the common "reset + create N entities + connect
 * them" pattern. Tests can also drop down to `store.getState().<action>`
 * for anything the helper doesn't cover.
